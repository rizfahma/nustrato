## November Rain, And Now It Is December Already

December last year feels like just a moment ago, and now it's December again, different year though.

I thought this year wouldn't rain this often, but in the last two days it's been raining quite often.

Last week I was a bit into Guns 'N Roses - November Rain song, and you know why. Because it was still November :-D  
That song stucked in my head for a few days, and surely the guitar melody as well makes it easier to stick.

**Do I like when it rains?**

Yes and No

Yeah I know I should have not be that ambigue. But let me explain:

Yes, I like when it rains, after a long hot day, especially in the night.

No, I don't like if it rains too much. Surely will make me struggle riding home.

But actuallyâ€¦

If it rains too much, I think it could affect the mood in general. Feels so lazy to go outside, which now I think I have to do more often. I can't stay inside and feeling bad having to deal with a lot of bad thoughts and stuff.

Too often raining makes it feel so gloomy actually. That's what I wanted to say since the beginning.

I don't need too much of gloomy feeling now, it is enough already though.

I still have to do a lot of things.

I still have to deal with many challenging things.

Might not be that entertaining or inspiring.

Or, Might be not bad at all.

All I know that I have to be ready, no matter if I am ready or not. It's part of the journey.

Life shouldn't be so boring, right?

May sunshine always be there with us, even though there's raining in between.

Cheers and Love.
