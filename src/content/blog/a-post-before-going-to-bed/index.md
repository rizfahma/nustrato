I just read the first chapter of “College Writing Skills” book. It was a very good book to learn how to write well. I found a usual sentence which suggested the reader to write a journal before going to bed. It said that at least we have to spend 15 minutes, and don’t be worry about making mistake as we write. Oh yes, that’s a good idea. I was always read about that tip to improve my writing, but unfortunately I never managed to make it. Is it because I didn’t want to write indeed, or I didn’t have enough time, or maybe because I was just want to make my writing perfect? I dunno exactly.


As I have been appointed as a tutor at writing class of my course, I had to think about it. I mean I have to maintain my writing skill, and to maintain it, I have to write often. I did not vow to make a post every day, because I am sure that I will not make it. I hope this post is a beginning of my regular posts every day since now.

> For you who is also want to improve writing skill, cheers!
