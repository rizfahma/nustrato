## Can't really do much about it

I just had my hair cut a few days ago. The first in 2025.

**Happy new year, by the way.**

The last time I had it was in November, before I went [to Turkey for an overseas training](https://riz.kim/sometime-in-turkey/). After that pretty much my hair grew wildly but kept relatively short like less than 8.5cm.

Sometimes I had my hair cut monthly, other times every two months, depending on my mood or whether I had time to go to a barbershop.

Since it's just a few days into the new year, and I saw my hair looked unkempt for several weeks already, I decided to have a haircut.

First I went to the last barbershop that I visited for my last haircut. The barber was sitting in the front of the shop, but the door was slightly opened. He was just sitting there playing his mobile phone. As I stopped there for a few second, I asked if they were opened or nah.

He said nah, would be opened on Monday.

I was like, woah this guy prolly didn't need any money. Oh prolly he just needed some days-off after having some new year's eve party I guess.

Well, I respected that.

So I took a turn on my scooter and headed back home.

I wasn't that happy actually, because I didn't want to wait till Monday to have my haircut. Matter fact, I wouldn't even sure that I would have some free time on Monday after hours. I would be tired coming home from the office.

In the last few years I had been to several barbershops. It hasn't been an easy journey to find the best one.

You are the subject, no tester or stuff. Straight go to your hair, and if it was failed, you should have waited for weeks to see your hair recovered.

So whether you like the hair cut or not, you will have to be patient.

Sometimes you had that good feeling that the barber did it well, and sometimes it went uhmâ€¦ not too good.

Finding another barbershop is like a gamble, nobody would take the huge L if it went badly other than yourself, as the subject. No matter how much you paid for it.

I said, tomorrow let's just find another barbershop since there were quite a lot of options around the area.

So I did.

The next day I decided to just go, having my hair cut.

### And how was the result?

The barbershop looked better actually, comfy, and clean. I liked it.

Waited till my turn, and here I go, I just sat there, having my hair cut.

The barber looked younger. And let me tell you guys, If it was not your huge passion, lack of experience also would cost your customers.

And yeah it was.

I had to give some instruction about how it should be, cutting like that, even for some basic preferences.  

I am no barber. But I knew how it should have been.

This guy probably still didn't have so much experience and also passion, I thought.

But as I implied, there were risks when you have your hair cut. Including this.

I didn't really want to be like a bad customer, so I let him "cook." I knew it would not be satisfying to me.

He sounded a little impatient too, maybe because it's getting darker outside. Maybe he was getting tired too.

Long story short, it was done, and I didn't want to stare at my brand new haircut too long in the mirror there. So I just went back home and took a shower.

I showed it to my sister, and for sure she knew. It should've been better, but actually not that horrible.

Yeah.

I was just not in the mood, even for complaining.

But hey, at least it looked neater than before. Appreciate that.

So, yeah. Having a haircut, especially in a new place is like a gamble. No matter what the result is, you will have to walk everywhere with the same haircut, and to recover it, it is going to take weeks.

I hope your haircut story goes well, fellas.

Cheers.
