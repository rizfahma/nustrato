## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, **please do not create a public issue**.  
Instead, report it privately by emailing [security@nustrato.com](mailto:security@nustrato.com) or via GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature.

- We will acknowledge your report within 3 business days.
- After triage, we will provide updates on remediation progress.
- Once resolved, we will credit you (if desired) and publish a security advisory.

**Please include:**
- A description of the vulnerability and its impact.
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code.
